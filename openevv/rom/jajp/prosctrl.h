/* What the prosody chain is, as records.
 *
 * `ProsCtrl` is the last thing between the analysis and the engine: it takes
 * the breath groups `IntonPhrase` built and writes the ESPR string the
 * synthesiser speaks -- phonemes with pitch and stress and pause annotations
 * threaded through them. IBM keeps it in three objects, `PCProsCtrl.obj`,
 * `PCRoman2BG.obj` and `PCWriteESPR2.obj`, and thirteen of the sixteen
 * objects in that chain are empty because everything was inlined away.
 *
 * The first thing it does is copy: `BG_T2BreathGroups` walks IntonPhrase's
 * chain and builds a four-level tree of its own out of it. That copy is what
 * says where every field of both records sits, and it is a second source for
 * IntonPhrase's own map -- it confirms eleven fields of rom/jajp/intonphrase.h
 * independently, and corrected one, since the int16 it reads at 0x66 of a
 * group phrase is where a twenty-ninth code of the reading would have been.
 *
 * The four levels, with what each holds and what allocates it:
 *
 *   BREATHGROUP   0x0c   one per breath group in the chain
 *   phrase        0x0c   BG_PHRASES of them, per group
 *   ACC_PHRASE    0x28   PH_WORDS of them, per phrase
 *   mora          0x1c   AP_MORAS of them, per accent phrase
 *
 * Nothing here is a transcription yet. It is what one has to agree with.

 * build where a pointer is eight bytes wide every one of them would run over
 * a field that is read.
 *
 * These records are this class's own -- operator new hands them out and
 * nothing of IBM's ever sees them -- so each is made one pointer longer than
 * IBM's and the pointer is parked at the end, which is what every record in
 * this directory does. IBM's field offsets are untouched, and the sweep pokes
 * the same offsets on both sides through a macro of its own.
