/* What Romanizer is, as a record.
 *
 * Romanizer derives from `ConverterInterface', which is
 * rom/jajp/convtinterface.c, so the two share one record: every field from
 * 0x00 to 0x1f belongs to the base and convtinterface.obj says what each one
 * is. The tail was a partial reading for as long as the class was unwritten
 * -- the size was known, since RomInstance asks operator new for 0x78 bytes,
 * and what was understood between 0x20 and 0x77 was what other classes
 * reached in for. rom/jajp/jpnrom.c is the class now and the names below are
 * what its own code uses.
 *
 * Two other classes do reach in, which is why the layout is not ours to
 * choose: InputChar goes up through TextAnalysis to ask the parameter block
 * whether annotations are in the text and to find the user dictionary, and
 * DictSearch reads two settings out of it directly.
 *
 * The evidence for the head being complete is mechanical. Every displacement
 * on a pointer anywhere in convtinterface.obj is one of 0x04, 0x08, 0x0c,
 * 0x10, 0x14, 0x18, 0x1c, 0x20 and 0x24, and the last two occur only on the
 * frame pointer, where they are arguments. So the base class has no field
 * above 0x1c and none between the ones named here.
