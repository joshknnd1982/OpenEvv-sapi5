/* What IntonPhrase is, as a record.
 *
 * IntonPhrase is the intonation. PhraseBuf and the path search leave a table
 * of accent phrases; this groups those into breath groups -- the stretches a
 * speaker says in one breath -- decides where the intonational phrases end,
 * and says how long each pause runs and what pitch each phrase carries.
 *
 * The size is settled: `Romanizer''s constructor asks for 0x69a4c bytes and
 * keeps the answer at RZ_INTON. Two of the three regions inside it are
 * settled by arithmetic rather than by any single line, which is the only
 * way a record of this shape can be read. `InitPhraseTable' lays out a link
 * chain of 707 entries at four bytes each from 0x14, which ends at 0xb20;
 * 707 records of 0x260 from 0xb20 end at 0x69a40, which is exactly where the
 * counters it writes sit. Neither number is chosen: 707 is the same count
 * TextAnalysis's own link chain and phrase table hold, so this is one record
 * per phrase of the sentence.
 *
 * tools/rom/offsets.py holds this against IBM's own object.
