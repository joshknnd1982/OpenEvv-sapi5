`eci.dll` exports the names IBM published, so a program written against IBM's library -- a screen reader add-on, for instance -- can load ours instead. It wants nothing but the system's own DLLs, and `eci.ini` goes beside it because add-ons look for one.

There is one of each bitness, in `eci-x86_64` and `eci-x86`, and which you want depends on the add-on rather than on Windows. An add-on that loads the engine into the screen reader's own process wants the reader's bitness -- sixty-four bit for NVDA 2026. The most used driver, davidacm/NVDA-IBMTTS-Driver, hosts the engine in a thirty-two bit process of its own whatever the reader is, so that one wants `eci-x86`. Copy the contents of the folder, not the folder.

On Linux the same names are in `libeci.so.1`, with `libeci.so` beside it and `eci.h` to compile against. `docs/using.md` is how to use it, `docs/api.md` what every call does, and `docs/quirks.md` what will trip you.

`openevv-say "Hello from Openevv."` speaks from the Linux command line through the first available ordinary audio client: `pw-play`, `paplay`, then `aplay`. `openevv-say -w hello.wav "Hello from Openevv."` saves the same speech instead. The lower-level `evv` command is beside it for programs that want a WAV file or pipe directly.

Every library here carries all ten languages: US and British English, German, Castilian and American Spanish, French and Canadian French, Italian, Japanese and Polish. `eciGetAvailableLanguages` answers all of them, US English is what a new instance speaks, and `eciSetParam(h, eciLanguageDialect, ...)` on an instance that is not speaking changes it. All ten can be alive in one process at once, each saying what it says alone.

`evvspeak.exe` is the speak window: type something, pick one of the eight voices, set the rate in words a minute, and hear it. `evv.exe` is the same engine on the command line. Both are one file, sixty-four bit, and want nothing installed.

The audio is byte for byte what IBM's own binary produces, over every test case there is for each language, from this build.

NOTICE says which parts of this are ours and which are IBM's: the engine is a reimplementation, and the language data it speaks with is IBM's, which the MIT licence does not cover.
