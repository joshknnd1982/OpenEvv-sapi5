/* The accent layer. evv_accent.h says what it is for; this says how.
 *
 * ---- the markup ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Markup is a group in braces, a letter first and then words with spaces
 * between them. Nothing is markup until a group beginning `{A v=1' has gone
 * by, so text that merely has a brace in it is left alone.
 *
 *   {A v=1 f0=own range=90 decl=10 ...}     the language: see profile_set
 *   {D id f2=85 f3=78 vot=15 ...}           a sound: see def_set
 *   {T id p=0:50,100:10 dur=100 ...}        a tone: see tone_set
 *   {X C t S}                               the module says C as t and then S
 *   {S d t}                                 the module may say d as t
 *   {W .1 t=rt a^55 .0 <h=hh a^- >q=gs}     a word, as it was meant
 *   {P s}                                   the phrase ends here, and how
 *
 * A word is its syllables: `.' and the stress digit the annotation gives the
 * syllable, then the phones in order under the names the annotation uses.
 * `=id' after a phone is the sound it was meant to be, a D group's id. `^id'
 * marks the phone as the syllable's nucleus and names its tone, a T group's
 * id, or `-' for none.
 *
 * A phone written with `<' or `>' in front of it is not in the annotation at
 * all. The module has nothing to say it with -- an h in Italian, a glottal
 * stop nearly anywhere -- so it is made here, out of the start of the phone
 * after it (`<') or the end of the phone before it (`>'), and its name is
 * only for whoever reads the markup.
 *
 * A phrase ends `s' as a statement, `q' as a question wanting yes or no, `w'
 * as a question with a question word, `e' as an exclamation, `c' where the
 * sentence goes on after a comma.
 *
 * ---- what happens to it --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * evv_accent_strip takes the groups out of the text and keeps what they
 * said. The words go on a queue, phone by phone, in the order they were
 * written.
 *
 * evv_accent_place is told each phone the rules are about to synthesise and
 * finds it in the queue. The module does not always say what it was given:
 * every module says an affricate as two phones, and the modules IBM wrote
 * for one language change a good deal besides. So the phone is looked for a
 * little way ahead rather than only next, a phone the module left out is
 * stepped over, and one it put in is let by with nothing said about it. X
 * and S groups say which differences a module is known to make.
 *
 * evv_accent_run is handed the frames. They do not arrive a phone at a time
 * -- the arrays the rules write run a little behind the phone they have just
 * named -- so the phones are kept in the order they were asked for and the
 * frames with the moment each belongs to, and a phone is worked on when all
 * of its frames have come.
 *
 * A phone's stretch begins where the mouth begins to move towards it and
 * ends where it begins to move towards the next, which is the engine's own
 * way of cutting speech up and is measured rather than assumed: the release
 * of a stop, and its aspiration, are at the start of the stretch after the
 * stop's own. So what a sound's definition says about formants is come to
 * over the first part of its stretch and held to the end of it, and what it
 * says about the release of a stop is done at the start of the next one.
 *
 * Formants are changed by ratio and never set. A module speaks with a voice
 * -- a head size, a sex -- that has already scaled every formant by the time
 * a frame arrives here, so the only thing that means the same in every voice
 * is how far a sound is from the module's own.
 *
 * Pitch is either the module's or ours. Where the language has tones, or a
 * melody of its own, the pitch the module worked out is dropped and a
 * contour is made here: a line of targets, one run of them to a syllable,
 * followed by a second order filter so that the voice moves between them
 * the way a larynx does, with a phrase's own fall and its ending added.

   runs a little behind: a stretch's last frames arrive with the next one's
   first, and sometimes a whole stretch arrives with the one after it. That
   is measured, and it is why nothing here is done to a frame as it arrives.

   So the phones are kept in the order they were asked for, each with the
   moments it was asked from and to, and the frames are kept with the moment
   each belongs to; and a phone's stretch is worked on when every frame of it
   has come. What that costs is that the sound is a phone behind the engine,
