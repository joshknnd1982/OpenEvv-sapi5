/* The language's own data, put where a value can name it.
 *
 * The rules and the tables name their data by address: delta_rule_sym holds
 * six and a half thousand pointers into the seventy-five stores of bytes the
 * compiler left in its objects, the set and action tables hold one pointer per
 * entry into two more stores, and a rule or the runtime hands one of those
 * addresses to the machine as a value. A value is thirty-two bits, so that
 * only works while the program itself sits somewhere a thirty-two bit value
 * can reach -- which is why the engine was linked low and told not to move.
 *
 * A shared library cannot be linked low: the loader puts it where it likes,
 * and in a sixty-four bit process that is far above what a value can name. So
 * every store the machine can be handed an address inside is copied, once,
 * into the arena, and an address in the program is translated to the address
 * of its copy at the few places where one crosses over into a value. After
 * that nothing the machine holds points into the program, and the program can
 * be loaded anywhere at all.
 *
 * Copied once for the process rather than once per engine, because sharing the
 * stores in the program amounted to the same thing: two instances have always
 * written to the same bytes, and they go on doing so.
