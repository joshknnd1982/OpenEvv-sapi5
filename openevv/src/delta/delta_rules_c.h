/* A reach the flow graph cannot settle, decided when the rule runs.

   Almost every reach through a register can be named, because the graph can
   say the register must hold the state there. One in the ten languages cannot:
   `evv_pnames3' loads the state into a register, later loads one of the
   language's own byte stores into the same register, and the reach sits under
   a label that only the alternative dispatch jumps to -- from six hundred
   lines below, and from after the second load. So on one path the register is
   the state and on another it is not, and no must-analysis may name it.

   Naming it anyway would be a guess, and a bad one to take on trust: the
   979 recorded cases never reach that line at all, so the gate could not
   catch a wrong answer. Only test/words.sh reaches it, and there the register
   was the state 1,116 times out of 1,116.

   So the rule asks. Where the pointer is the state the reach is the variable,
   wherever the next build puts it; where it is not, it is the offset the
   compiler emitted, which is what that path meant. Exact under both, and it
   costs a compare on a line the cases never execute.

   No sabotage proves this one, and that is not an omission. Moving the named
   branch two bytes changes nothing in the 98 cases or the 24,318 words,
   because the read feeds `== 1' and both the right value and a wrong one fail
   it alike -- the site runs, as the instrumentation showed, but its value is
   not observable from outside. Which is the whole argument for asking rather
   than assuming: a wrong answer here would never show up. What is checked
   instead is that the two branches name one address today, statically and
   exactly: DG_s326 is DG_BASE + 2386, DG_BASE is 176, and the offset the
