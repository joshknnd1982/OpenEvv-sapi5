/* The interpreter for the language's rules.
 *
 * A rule is a byte stream of operations over operands, produced by
 * tools/rules/emit.py from what the language's own compiler generated. The
 * machine it runs on is the one that code was written for: eight registers,
 * the four condition flags, a frame of bytes addressed from a base, and
 * calls out to the runtime. Nothing here is a translation into something
 * nicer; that comes later, once this is known to be exact.
 *
 * The frame is one buffer with the base part way up it, because the code was
 * compiled that way: locals below the base, the rule's own arguments above.
 * An offset is signed and reaches either side.
 *
 * One operation is not a call at all although it looks like one. A rule
 * plants a landing place for a backtrack by calling setjmp, and a call made
 * from here would land back in this function rather than in the rule, so it
 * is taken as an operation of its own and the landing place is this
 * function's. Everything the interpreter needs afterwards therefore lives in
 * one block whose address has escaped, so that a landing does not find it
 * stale. */

/* One call to a primitive, with the arity known where the call is written.

   Every call a rule makes used to go through delta_rule_called, which cleared
   a scratch array of twenty-five words, copied the arguments into it off the
   back of the machine's argument area, and then read the arity again in
   call_entry to pick which signature to make the call under. That last one
   was an indirect branch through a jump table on every call, and between them
   the two were a fifth of a run.

   A rule written as C knows its arity where it stands, so it says which of
   these it wants and the whole of that goes: no array, no copy, no branch on
   the arity. What is left is reading the arguments off the top of the
   argument area, in the order the entry takes them -- the last thing pushed
   is the first argument -- and making the call.

   Two things send it back to the old path. Tracing wants the arguments
   written out, which no rule should pay for; and an argument area shallower
   than the call asks for is a place the compiled code and the interpreter
   disagree about, which delta_rule_called answers with noughts as it always
   has. Both are the one test at the top.

   All twenty-six arities are here whether or not English uses them. Which a
   language wants is the language's business, and a missing one would be a
   link error in the middle of somebody else's build.
