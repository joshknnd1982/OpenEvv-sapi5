 * The frication and aspiration source is white: klatt_rand puts one value
 * per output sample in the buffer and nothing bounds it, so the noise
 * occupies whatever band the rate gives it. At 11,025 that is right by
 * accident -- Nyquist is 5,512 and the source is meant to stop there. Ask
 * the synthesiser for 22,050 and the same code spreads the same energy over
 * twice the band; at 44,100 there is as much of it above 11 kHz as between
 * 5.5 and 11, which is why sibilants synthesised outright go thin and hissy
 * and why raising the rate afterwards has been the only way up.
 *
 * So bound it where the engine's own rate bounds it. Two poles at 5,512
 * hertz, and a gain of sqrt(rate / 11025) to put back the power the band
 * limit takes out: white noise at rate R carries its variance over R/2 of
 * spectrum, so confining it to a fixed 5,512 without that gain would leave
 * the band quieter than 11,025 leaves it rather than the same.
 *
 * At 11,025 and below this does nothing at all, by the test below rather
 * than by the arithmetic coming out to unity. That is deliberate: it is what
 * keeps every recorded case byte for byte what it was.

/* ---- the resonators, with a fraction to their name ---------------------
 *
 * pole_filter keeps its state in the output buffer as whole numbers, and
 * shifts each of the three products down by fifteen before summing them. So
 * every sample of the recursion is truncated to an integer and that error is
 * fed straight back. What a resonator does with a feedback error depends on
 * how close its poles sit to the unit circle, and raising the sample rate is
 * precisely what pushes them there: a pole at a 60 hertz bandwidth has a
 * radius of 0.983 at 11,025 and 0.996 at 44,100, and the round-off noise a
 * direct form throws off grows with the square of the distance closing.
 *
 * That is why the fixed point engine upsamples worse than a floating point
 * one while sounding the same at 11,025 -- the design is tuned where the
 * arithmetic is comfortable, and nothing about the tuning says so.
 *
 * So above the engine's own rate, keep the state in a double beside the
 * block rather than truncated in the buffer. The coefficients stay exactly
 * the ones the fixed point path built, so this separates the two questions:
 * what the state's precision costs, which is this, from what the
 * coefficients' precision costs, which is a further change if this is not
 * enough.
 *
 * The state cannot go in filter_parms: that block is IBM's field for field
 * and the thirty-two bit build checks every offset. It is keyed by the
 * resonator's own address instead, which is stable and unique because each
 * one lives in the array inside the synthesiser's block.
 *
 * UNFINISHED, and off unless EVV_WIDE=on asks for it. Where it has got to,
 * on 6 September 2026:
 *
 * EVV_WIDE=emulate runs this same shadow carrying the narrow path's own
 * arithmetic, and requires the two to come out bit for bit identical. That
 * is the check that says whether a difference is precision or structure, and
 * it has already earned itself. It said structure, twice.
 *
 * The first was the whole of the spikes: KlattSynth zeroes d1 and d2 itself
 * when a filter resets between frames, and a shadow that did not follow went
 * on ringing from state the engine had silenced. Peak 32316 against the
 * narrow path's 5027, clipping at ordinary volume, and the clipping was what
 * filled the band above 5,512 with 54 dB of nonsense. Resyncing whenever the
 * two disagree brings it to peak 4884 against 5027 and RMS 875 against 989 --
 * the same signal, near enough to argue about.
 *
 * The second is still open. Emulate and narrow first differ at sample 16 and
 * then almost everywhere, by up to 1483 counts. Sixteen is early enough to be
 * a block boundary rather than anything in the recursion, so the state handed
 * from one call to the next is the place to look, and the `n > 1' arm at the
 * end of pole_filter -- which does something odd when n is nought or one --
 * is the first suspect. As it stands the wide
 * path is wrong rather than merely different: at a quarter volume, where
 * nothing clips, it comes out 10.8 dB quieter in RMS than the narrow one and
 * with a peak three times higher, which is spikes rather than speech, and at
 * full volume those spikes clip and fill the band above 5,512 with the
 * distortion. Precision alone cannot do that -- fxmul_scaled is a block
 * floating point multiply rather than a plain shift, so the narrow path is
 * far less lossy than it looks -- so there is a structural mistake in here
 * and not just a difference of arithmetic.
 *
 * The check that would find it: make this path truncate each of the three
 * products separately, exactly as the narrow one does, and require the two
 * to agree bit for bit. If they do not, the recursion is wrong; if they do,
 * the difference really is precision and the spikes are something the
 * truncation was holding down. */
