/* Two managers the formant engine never asks anything of.
 *
 * The synthesis thread holds three: a filter manager, a romanizer manager,
 * and a concatenation manager. The first of those is real and is in
 * src/eci/ssml/eci_filtermanager.c, since the SSML reader hangs off it. The other
 * two are here. The romanizer belongs to the languages that are written in
 * another script. The concatenative manager belongs to the other engine;
 * this extraction runs the formant one.
 *
 * So these are interfaces met rather than code transcribed, on the same
 * footing as the sound boundary. Each answers the way an empty manager
 * would: nothing is present, nothing is active, nothing is supported.
 *
 * Names are prefixed and the aliases at the foot carry the real ones. */

   thread hands the manager and reads back out of it, and one of them -- the
   sample rate -- is handed on to a romanizer, which is the only thing in the
   engine that ever asks. So an empty manager cannot answer nought here; it
   has to remember.

   the synthesis thread's sample callback asks the manager whether what it is

   Ours never can, because in this extraction every sample comes from the
   formant synthesiser at the engine's own rate. So it is one, always, and
   the converter in src/eci/sound/eci_pcm.c is what raises it. It was left unset before
