/* The one filter IBM shipped: SSML in, the engine's own annotations out.
 *
 * It owns three things -- the reader's state, the XML parser, and a copy of
 * the last answer -- and does very little itself. `filterText' is what the
 * manager calls: it resets the state, hands the text to `filterSSMLText',
 * which drives the parser, and takes a copy of what the reader built so
 * that the caller has something that outlives the next call.
 *
 * A lock is held across the whole of that, and has to be. The scanner in
 * src/eci/ssml/eci_xmltok.c keeps its state in variables of its own rather than in
 * the parser, so two threads filtering at once would read each other's
 * document. IBM's lock is one for the class, not one for the object,
 * which is the same reasoning.
 *
 * Names are prefixed and the aliases at the foot carry the real ones.
