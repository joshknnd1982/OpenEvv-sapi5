/* A filter, the thing that stands between the caller's text and the engine.
 *
 * The published interface is a plain C entry point in a library of the
 * caller's own: it is handed a number saying which of two things is wanted
 * and answers with a pointer. Number seven asks for the filter object
 * itself, whose methods are below; number eight asks for a function that
 * says whether a given string is something this filter would want to look
 * at. `eciRegisterFilter' takes that entry point and the manager in
 * src/eci/ssml/eci_filtermanager.c does the rest.
 *
 * The order of the methods below is IBM's and cannot be rearranged. It is
 * the order a filter compiled against the published headers puts them in,
 * so a filter written for the original engine and this one have to agree
 * on it slot for slot.
 *
 * src/eci/ssml/eci_filter.c is the base every filter inherits, which does nothing
 * but remember whether it is on. src/eci/ssml/eci_ssmlfilter.c is the one filter
 * IBM shipped.
