/* Which filters exist, which are loaded, and which are on.
 *
 * Two lists, and they are not the same list. The registry is what
 * `eciRegisterFilter' writes: a chain of records saying that a filter of
 * such a name, for such a language, under such a number, can be reached
 * through such an entry point. Nothing is loaded by registering. The
 * loaded list is what `eciNewFilter' writes: an actual filter object, got
 * by calling that entry point, with the version it reported beside it.
 *
 * So a number means two different things depending on which list is being
 * asked. In the registry it is the number the caller chose, one of twenty;
 * in the loaded list it is the same number, but a filter can be loaded
 * once per language and the pair is what identifies it.
 *
 * Three things in here are stubs in IBM's own build, not just in this one:
 * `getINIValue' answers nothing and `autoLoadFilter' does nothing, which
 * together are the whole of the path that would have found a filter in a
 * library and loaded it without being asked. That is why the SSML filter,
 * which is compiled into every language module, is never on unless a
 * caller registers it -- and why registering it by hand works, since the
 * rest of the path is all here.
 *
 * The environment is the other half of this file. A filter that says it is
 * version seven or better is handed one when it loads, and what it can ask
 * through it is the language, the voice and the volume the engine is
 * currently set to. The SSML reader needs all three: a percentage
 * loudness has to be a percentage of something, and an `xml:lang' has to
 * be compared against what is in force.
 *
 * Names are prefixed and the aliases at the foot carry the real ones.
