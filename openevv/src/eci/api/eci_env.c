/* What the sample rate setting means, and how the engine is to produce it.

   IBM numbered four rates and shipped two. The first four numbers keep the
   rates IBM gave them and always will. What they no longer mean is that the
   engine runs at them.

   Every rate above eleven thousand and twenty five is reached by running the
   engine at one of its own two and repeating each sample, rather than by
   synthesising at the higher rate. The synthesiser will do either -- it can
   be built resonator tables for any rate, and src/klatt/klatt_rates.c is that --
   but they do not sound the same and holding is the one worth having.
   Synthesising higher widens the noise the frication and aspiration are made
   of, because that generator produces one value per output sample, so the
   sibilants go thin and hissy. Holding touches none of it: the speech is bit
   for bit the speech Eloquence has always made, and what fills the new band
   is a mirror of it rather than new noise. That mirror is what a bandlimited
   resampler exists to remove, and keeping it is the sound old hardware made.

   So the rule is the rate itself and there is nothing else to carry: above
   eleven thousand and twenty five the engine runs at eleven thousand and
   twenty five and the samples are repeated, and at or below it the engine
   runs at the rate asked for. Twenty-two and forty-four thousand are whole
   multiples and every sample is repeated the same number of times; sixteen,
   thirty-two and forty-eight are not, and each output sample takes the input
   sample nearest it in time, which is the same idea with uneven repeats and
   still no interpolation and no filtering.

   EVV_UPSAMPLE=none turns the holding off and synthesises everything at its
   own rate, which is how the two are compared without a rebuild. The other
   values of it choose between ways of filling the gap and src/eci/sound/eci_pcm.c
   describes them.

   Two of these are fixes to IBM rather than additions. The device form knew
   sixteen thousand and the sample form did not, so a buffer could not have
   it; both forms answer the same table now. And IBM's twenty-two and sixteen
   thousand were meant to be exactly this -- the other two doubled by an
   AudioConverter -- and the object that was to do it is the one this port
   never transcribed, so what a caller got was the undoubled stream under the
   doubled label, the same speech at half the duration. That is what these
   now do, some twenty-seven years later.

   version of the other one. Forty-eight thousand held from it was tried --
   six copies of every sample, exactly -- and it is that voice at forty-eight
   thousand rather than a better one: the band from three to five and a half
   thousand comes out six decibels louder than eleven thousand puts it, and
   the envelope is nearly fourteen decibels away.
