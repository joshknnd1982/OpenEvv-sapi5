/* Raising the sample rate, and what goes between the samples.

   The engine runs at eleven thousand and twenty five and every rate above it
   is made from that, so this is what decides what a caller actually hears
   above the engine's own ceiling. src/eci/sound/eci_pcm.c says what each way sounds
   like and why the default is what it is.

   It is declared here rather than kept inside that file so the arithmetic
   can be driven directly, without an engine behind it. test/harness/rates.c does
   that: a run split into several blocks has to come out identical to the
   same run handed over whole, which is the one property no measurement of
   the audio would catch and the one a mistake in the history would break.

/* The windowed sinc, and the two numbers worth arguing about.

   How far up the band it passes, as a fraction of the input's own Nyquist,
   and how many samples it reaches over. The two trade against each other:
   taking the filter closer to Nyquist leaves it less room to fall, so it
   needs more samples to fall as steeply, and a Kaiser window of this shape
   puts the stopband roughly 2.285 times the transition times the taps, in
   radians, below the passband.

   The first choice here was 0.91 over 48 samples, copied from what soxr uses
   at its medium setting, and it was wrong for this engine. At eleven
   thousand and twenty five, 0.91 of Nyquist is 5,016 hertz, and Eloquence
   has real speech above that -- measured, the band from 5,016 to 5,512
   carries 27 decibels less than the band below it, which is quiet but is
   not nothing. Cutting there threw away 12.4 decibels of it, and that was
   heard: the voice came out duller than it should be.

   So 0.98 over 192 samples. Measured on the same sentence, that band now
   comes through 1.1 decibels under where the engine put it, against 12.4
   before, and the images are still 83 decibels down. Pushing further costs
   more than it returns: 0.99 over 256 gains another half a decibel of speech
   and gives up fifteen of stopband. Ninety-six samples of delay is under
   nine milliseconds at the engine's rate.

   EVV_SINC_CUTOFF and EVV_SINC_TAPS move both, because where exactly to put
   them is a matter for a listener and not for this file. */
