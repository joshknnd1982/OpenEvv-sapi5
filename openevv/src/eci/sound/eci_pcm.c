/* ---- turning one sample format into another -------------------------- */

/* Raising the rate, four ways, none of them the engine's business.

   This is the one object of IBM's sound layer the port never transcribed,
   and it is the reason a caller asking for twenty-two thousand used to be
   handed the eleven thousand stream under a twenty-two thousand label -- the
   same speech at half the duration. It is ours rather than a transcription,
   for the reason the head of this file gives about the rest of the layer.

   The engine runs at eleven thousand and twenty five and this decides what
   the samples in between are. Which way is a matter for a listener, so there
   are four and EVV_UPSAMPLE picks:

   hold    the sample before, repeated until the next one is due. Keeps the
   mirror of the speech that a resampler exists to remove, which is
   what old hardware did and what some ears want. Every value that
   comes out is a value the engine put in, so what a caller gets at
   twenty-two thousand is Eloquence to the byte.
   zeros   the sample, then silence until the next is due. The mirror at
   full strength with no droop at the top of the band: brighter and
   harder still, and quieter, since only one sample in so many
   carries anything.
   linear  a straight line between one sample and the next. Suppresses the
   mirror by roughly twice what holding does.
   cubic   a curve through four of them, which is what libsoxr calls its
   quick mode. It suppresses the mirror by some nine decibels over
   holding, which is a rate change rather than an effect, and it is
   well short of removing it.
   sinc    a windowed sinc across a hundred and ninety-two of them,
   which is what a resampler actually is and is the default. The
   images are gone rather than quieter -- some fifty decibels below
   where the curve leaves them -- and the passband comes through
   flat instead of drooping at the top. Where it stops passing and
   how many samples it takes to stop are in eci_pcm.h with the
   argument for the particular numbers, and EVV_SINC_CUTOFF and
   EVV_SINC_TAPS move them.

   The sinc is the default because the curve was not enough. Held against
   Apple's driver, which does its own resampling out of an eci.dylib that
   only runs at eight and eleven thousand, the curve was the closest of the
   cheap ways and still short of it. What separates a resampler from an
   interpolator is the stopband, and only a real filter has one.

   Written here rather than linked from libsoxr because the engine has no
   dependency but the C library and gains none here: this ships inside a DLL
   a screen reader loads and inside builds for platforms nobody has put soxr
   on. Same arithmetic, not the same code.

   Both interpolating ways look only backwards, at samples already handed
   over, so a run joins the one before it with no seam and nothing is held
   back at the end. What that costs is a constant delay of one input sample
   for linear and two for cubic -- under two tenths of a millisecond -- which
   is why the history below is three samples deep.

   The ratio need not be whole. Position is counted in units of one input
   sample over the output rate, so twenty-two and forty-four thousand come to
   an even number of copies and sixteen, twenty-four, thirty-two and
   forty-eight thousand come to an uneven one, by the same arithmetic.
