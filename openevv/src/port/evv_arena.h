/* Where the machine's memory lives, and how a pointer to it fits in a value.
 *
 * The Delta machine keeps every value in a signed 32-bit slot and puts host
 * addresses in some of them. On a 32-bit build that is simply true and the
 * casts below are what the code has always said. On a 64-bit one it is only
 * true if everything a value can point at lives low enough to be named in 32
 * bits, which is what the arena is for: one region, taken below the two
 * gigabyte mark, out of which everything the machine can hold a pointer to is
 * allocated.
 *
 * Nothing here changes what a 32-bit build compiles to. EVV_REF and EVV_AT
 * expand to exactly the casts that were written by hand before, so the whole
 * conversion can be made and proved against both suites before an arena
 * exists at all.
