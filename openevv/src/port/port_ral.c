   Each call takes a request block rather than a bare handle, with two slots
   that matter: one twelve bytes in and one four bytes after it. Every family
   uses them differently, and each shape below was read off the one caller
   that builds the block.

   Creating a plain semaphore puts the initial count in the first slot and
   takes the new identifier back out of the second. Creating an event puts
   the initial state in the first slot and the caller's own object in the
   second, that object being the identity from then on. Creating a recursive
   mutex puts the caller's object in the first slot and a flag in the second.
   Every operation afterwards, whichever family, names the thing in the first
   slot.

   So identity is sometimes a number this layer invents and sometimes an
   address the caller already had. Both are just keys, and the table below is
   keyed by the value itself either way. */

/* The table, and the one rule about it.
 *
 * Three of the engine's threads use this at once -- measured rather than
 * assumed, with RAL_TRACE over a single utterance: 1,127 operations from
 * one thread, 1,135 from another and 35 from a third. For a long while
 * nothing guarded it, and what that cost is worth knowing because it did
 * not look like a locking bug from outside. Two threads binding at the same
 * time would both find the same free slot and one would lose its object, so
 * a later lookup missed a key that was there; the wait under it then
 * answered that it had failed, and the engine went on without the lock.
 * What showed at the top was IBM's own Mutex writing `wait failed' to its
 * trace, one run in three hundred on thirty-two bits, moving a hash in the
 * gate. docs/status.md has the whole account.
 *
 * So: every entry point below takes evv_low_lock, and the helpers between
 * them assume it is held. The one condition that cannot be relaxed is that
 * nothing may block while holding it -- the thing being waited on is handed
 * out by this very table, so a thread sleeping with the guard would keep
 * the thread that would wake it from ever reaching the post. The two
 * blocking paths therefore let go of the guard first, and `busy' is how the
 * slot survives the gap: a delete arriving in the middle unbinds the key at
 * once, so nothing new finds it, and leaves the object for the last waiter
 * out to destroy. */

/* The audio device layer.

   Everything here reports the way a C function reports an error, zero
   meaning nothing went wrong, which is the opposite of what the semaphore
   waits do. That was read off ealaudio.obj, which logs an error on any
   non-zero answer.

   It claims one device and accepts everything asked of it without ever
   producing a sound. The engine will not construct an instance at all
   unless it can open an output device, so one has to exist; but the samples
   are taken from it through its own buffer interface instead, so the device
   is only ever opened and closed again.

   The capability block is twenty-four bytes with a mask of the sample rates
   the device will take at offset twenty. The four bits it looks at mean
   eight thousand, eleven thousand and twenty-five, twenty-two thousand and
   fifty, and sixteen thousand, in that order of bit position; all four are
   offered. */
