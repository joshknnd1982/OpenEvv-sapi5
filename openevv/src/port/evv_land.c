   A name is the address of the buffer a rule planted its landing in, and the
   same few addresses come round again and again: a frame comes off the frame
   stack, so a rule at the same depth gets the same one. That is why nothing is
   ever given back -- the table settles at as many entries as there are places
   a landing is ever planted, which is dozens, and a name that comes round
   again wants the same place anyway.

   round again, so a sibling that has already gone can have saved a stack
   pointer above the frame asking. Trying that first gave a stack smashing
   report instead of the abort it replaced.

   So the depth is bracketed instead. delta_run_rule takes a mark before it
   runs a rule and releases to it after, which un-plants whatever that rule
   planted, and the entries left are exactly the ones whose frames are still
   there. Sixteen deep is far more than the rules go -- the deepest run seen
   is nine -- and going over it costs the fallback rather than anything else.

   It happens when the name outlives the thread that planted it. The name is
   the address of a rule's frame and the frame is in the arena, which every
   thread shares, so a name does travel between threads even though a landing
   place cannot -- the machine keeps the one it means to return to in its own
   state, where whoever stops the engine can reach it. Saying so is the whole
   point of this: the caller has asked the machine to backtrack on a thread
   that was never in the rule. */
/* Where a forced error backtrack goes when the rule that asked for one never
   planted its own landing.

   A rule sets the machine's err_jmp when it enters -- ventproc is handed the
   buffer -- and plants the landing in it a moment later, and those are two
   steps. An error forced in between names a buffer with nothing in it. That
   is not a hole in the port: IBM's engine longjmps into an uninitialised
   buffer at the same moment, which is why every string in
   test/cases/crashers.txt takes an unhandled page fault there.

   The nearest enclosing rule's landing looks like the answer and is not.
   Landing on it does answer one and the rule does take its error path, but
   the backtracking stack still carries a marker for every rule that was
   skipped, so that rule's vretproc pops one belonging to something else and
   reads a record out of whatever is there. Tried, and it turned an abort into
   a segmentation fault inside vretproc.

   So the landing is the outermost rule call's instead. Nothing is unwound
   half way there: the whole run is abandoned, delta_run_rule answers nought,
   and the utterance goes rather than the process, which is what the walk
   bound's own comment in delta.c says it is for. */
