 * published, the numbers they take, and the two macros that say how they are
 * called. The engine's own short names -- eo_new, et_addText, ev_setParam --
 * are internal and are not in here, because the whole point of a published
 * interface is that it does not move when the inside does.
 *
 * lib/eci_api.c is built from this, which is what makes the header and the
 * libraries one description rather than two. The other two places in the tree
 * that declare these names keep their own copies for reasons: cli/evv.c links
 * the archive and calls the engine's short names, which are not published and
 * are not in here, and test/lib/dll.c resolves every name at run time on
 * purpose, so that what it proves is the export table rather than the header.
 *
 * The numbers are this engine's, read out of the code that acts on them
 * rather than out of IBM's header, and where the two differ it is said so
 * against the name. docs/api.md is the prose; this is the declaration.

/* ---- text filters, which is how SSML is read -------------------------- */

/* The engine carries the SSML reader and never loads it by itself, so
 * turning it on is three calls: register the filter with the entry point,
 * make one, and activate it. Where IBM's caller got that entry point out of
 * a DLL of its own -- ssmlfilter.dll, asking for ssmlFilterGetObject -- ours
 * is in this library under the same name, so there is one fewer file to find.
 *
 * What eciRegisterFilter takes is the address of that entry point, and it
 * reads it through a pointer: hand it the address of a variable holding the
 * function, not the function.
