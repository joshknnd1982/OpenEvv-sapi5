"""Speak through the library with ctypes, the way a screen reader add-on does.

The C harness beside this one, test/lib/dll.c, checks that the names are exported
and that a callback survives the crossing. This checks the thing an add-on
actually depends on: that ctypes' own idea of the calling convention, of a
handle and of a callback matches what the library expects. Those are different
questions, and the second one is the one that bites -- a handle is sixty-four
bits and ctypes will happily pass thirty-two of them unless it is told.

A document in place of the text is read as SSML: the filter is registered
through the exported calls first, which is a second question again, since a
filter's entry point is a callback of the caller's and goes over as stdcall
with a pointer-to-pointer in front of it.

It takes either kind of library: eci.dll on Windows and libeci.so
everywhere else. Which convention a callback goes over by, and which codec
turns text into the engine's own bytes, follow from that.

usage: test/lib/dll.py <eci.dll or libeci.so> <out.wav> <text>
