# One sentence, so this is the smoke test rather than the gate: it answers in
# two seconds and it is what to run between edits. test/matrix.sh is the gate
# and asks the same question of 791 cases over nine languages, with the
# interface's own answers held as well as the audio.
#
# The samples do not depend on the compiler: gcc 15 and clang 21 agree byte for
# byte, which is what you would hope from an engine whose arithmetic is all
# integer. So a hash in the tree is a fair thing to hold a build to.
