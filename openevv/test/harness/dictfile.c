/* Read a dictionary in from a file and hear that it took.
 *
 * eciLoadDict and eciSaveDict were published and left unwritten: both
 * answered eciDictNotSupported whatever they were handed. Nothing in the
 * suite could see that, because nothing in the suite loads a dictionary --
 * cli/probe.c walks the dictionary layer far enough to make one, put it in
 * force and take it away again, and the reference answers the same refusal
 * from the same stub, so both sides agreed. A caller with a file of
 * pronunciations had no way in at all, since the per-entry calls are not
 * exported by the older interface either.
 *
 * Three things are checked. Loading has to answer that it worked. The word
 * the dictionary names has to come out different from the way it comes out
 * without it. And saving has to write the entry back.
 *
 * The second is the one that matters, and it is why this speaks twice rather
 * than once: a dictionary that is merely made and put in force changes the
 * audio on its own, so holding a run with a dictionary against a run without
 * one proves nothing. Both runs here load a dictionary and differ only in
 * whether it names the word being spoken.
 *
 * test/harness/dict.c is the neighbour and the other question: what the eight
 * dictionary calls answer, held against IBM's own objects. This one asks
 * whether a file of pronunciations can get in at all, which IBM's answer to
 * is that it cannot.
 *
 * usage: dictfile
