/* The XML scanner, ours against IBM's, one document at a time.
 *
 * The scanner is flex's automaton with IBM's forty-eight actions on top,
 * and what has to be right about it is the token stream: which runs of
 * text come out as character data, where a tag begins and ends, what its
 * attributes are called and what they are worth, and which documents are
 * refused. None of that is visible in the audio, and only some of it is
 * visible in the annotations the SSML reader makes -- a document the
 * scanner tokenises differently may still come out sounding the same.
 *
 * So this drives the parser directly and prints every call the three
 * handlers get. The same file is compiled twice: once against our engine
 * and once against IBM's objects, where the parser's methods are mangled
 * C++ names and are reached by name rather than through its table.
 * `test/harness/xmltok.sh' diffs the two.
 *
 * Every document is copied into a buffer of its own before being parsed,
 * and that is not tidiness. IBM's narrowing pass terminates the digits of a
 * numeric character reference by writing a nought over the semicolon in the
 * text it was given, so a document handed over as a string literal faults
 * on `&#65;'. src/eci/ssml/eci_mbconvert.c does not, and says why; passing a copy is
 * what lets the two be compared past that point.
 *
 * The documents are chosen to reach the corners the automaton was taken
 * whole for: entities in text and inside quoted attribute values, an
 * attribute with no value, `/>' which is handled by pushing the two
 * characters back into the input, a close tag whose name does not match,
 * text long enough to make the text buffer grow twice, more attributes
 * than a tag has room for, and elements nested deeper than the tag stack
 * starts out.
