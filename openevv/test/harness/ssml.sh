# The SSML reader, ours against IBM's.

# test/harness/ssml.c is the list of documents and is compiled twice: by the
# top-level `make ssml' against our engine, and by `make -C reference ssml'
# against IBM's objects. Both register the SSML filter through the published
# interface, turn it on, and print the annotations every document turns
# into, and this diffs them.
#
# It wants Wine and IBM's objects, like test/harness/ipa.sh and unlike
# test/matrix.sh.
#
# usage: test/harness/ssml.sh [cases.txt]
