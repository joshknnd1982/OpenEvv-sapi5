/* What the language decided a word was made of, as phonemes.
 *
 * `eciGeneratePhonemes' asks the engine to say what it would say, in the
 * engine's own alphabet, instead of saying it. That is a sharper thing to
 * check than the audio: a wrong letter-to-sound answer names itself here,
 * where in a wave file it is a different hash over forty thousand samples.
 *
 * This is our side. `reference/phontry.c' is the same driver against IBM's
 * own objects and prints the same shape, so the two outputs are held
 * against each other line for line by test/harness/phonemes.sh.
 *
 * The text comes from a file, one case to a line, rather than from the
 * command line: an argument handed to a Windows binary under Wine is
 * recoded on the way in, and a case with an accented letter in it then
 * reaches the two engines as different bytes and looks like a difference
 * that is not one.
 *
 * usage: phonemes <cases.txt>
