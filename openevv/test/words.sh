#
# The gate a level below test/matrix.sh: one word to a line rather than one
# sentence, and what the engine says it is made of rather than what it sounds
# like.
#
# Why both. The sentence gate has 98 English cases in it, which is the right
# size for asking whether the engine still says what it always said, and far
# too small for asking whether a change to a rule or a dictionary was a good
# idea. A change that mends forty words and breaks four hundred passes it
# without a murmur. Twenty thousand words will not.
#
# It reads what `eciGeneratePhonemes' answers rather than the audio, which is
# what makes it affordable: no wave file, no hashing, nothing to compare but
# text, and a moved word names itself instead of being a hash that changed.
# It wants neither Wine nor IBM's objects.
#
# A word that moves is a question, exactly as in the sentence gate. Say in the
# commit which moved and why, then `test/words.sh record' writes them down.
#
# usage: test/words.sh check  [lang ...]     the default
#        test/words.sh record [lang ...]
#
# EVV_WORDS_NATIVE names a phonemes binary to drive rather than building one,
# and EVV_WORDS_JOBS how many processes to run at once, every core by default.
