# Every case of every language, held against what this engine has said before.
#
# This is the gate. test/suite.sh proved the engine against IBM's own binary
# and that proof is done: all nine of the SDK's languages came out byte for
# byte identical over every case there is for them, in every build the tree
# makes.
# What is wanted from here on is different -- the engine is being changed on
# purpose now, and the question is no longer whether it is IBM's but whether
# anything moved that nobody meant to move. So the answers are written down
# and held to, and a case that moves has to be explained rather than merely
# noticed.
#
# What is recorded, per case, is two hashes rather than one, because they fail
# in different ways. The samples say what came out of the synthesiser. The
# probe's own reported answers -- the parameters read back, the index marks,
# the phonemes, what the dictionary calls returned -- say what the interface
# did, and the audio cannot see that. A permanently silent instance once
# passed all 81 cases on both sides of the differential suite because nothing
# there changed a rate; an answer that stops being reported shows up here.
#
# Every number in test/samples was blessed by IBM's binary at the moment it
# was written: the whole differential suite was run for each lifted language
# immediately before its numbers were recorded, so each is a value the
# original had just agreed with. Polish is the exception and its file says so
# -- IBM never shipped Polish, there is nothing to hold it to, and what is
# recorded is what this engine does, which is still worth having as the only
# way a change to Polish can be told from an accident.
#
# It wants neither Wine nor IBM's objects. That is the point of it.
#
# usage: test/matrix.sh check  [lang ...]     the default
#        matrix.sh record [lang ...]     write the baselines instead
#
# EVV_MATRIX_NATIVE names a binary to drive rather than building one, which is
# how the Windows build and the thirty-two bit build are checked against the
# same numbers.

# The eight comparisons test/suite.sh makes, said here in the same order and
# with the same mode letters so that the two harnesses ask the same questions
# of the engine. That is deliberate and it is what makes the baselines worth
# anything: every one of them is a number the suite had just agreed with, and
# a category the suite could not run would be a number nothing had blessed.
#
# A category is a case file and the letters the probe is given: `anno' turns
# the annotation input type on, `a' and `r' ask for the settings to be read
# back in a person's units, `d' exercises the dictionary calls, and `t' says
# the text twice on one instance.
#
# That last is the one to explain. The engine's second utterance is not its
# first and that is faithful rather than random: the same sentence twice gives
# the same number of samples both times and most of them differ, because the
# machine's state has moved on. It is entirely deterministic -- three
# processes give the same first utterance and the same second one, and IBM's
# engine does it too, to the same samples -- so it is a thing that can be
# recorded, and nothing else in the tree records it. A change that quietly
# reset the state between utterances would move nothing else here.
#
# `ssml' is the eighth and the newest. Its case is a document rather than a
# sentence: the probe registers the SSML filter, asks it what the document
# turns into, and speaks that, so the recorded answer covers the reader and
# the engine together. Polish is in it like the rest, and Polish is the
# reason it is worth having -- there is no Polish oracle, so a recorded gate
# is the only thing besides an ear that can tell a change to the reader from
# an accident there.
