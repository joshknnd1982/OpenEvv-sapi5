# These are the words IBM's engine cannot say. Each of them takes an unhandled
# page fault in the original -- the same fault, on a node reference of nought
# -- so there is no reference audio to hold ours against and this is not part
# of the differential suite. What it checks is only that ours answers: either
# it speaks the word or it gives the utterance up, and in both cases the
# process is still there afterwards. That is the whole point of the guards in
# src/delta/delta.c, and this is what says they are still in place.
#
# It wants neither Wine nor IBM's objects, so it runs anywhere the engine
# builds. Like test/hash.sh it is one of the two quick ones.
#
# usage: test/crashers.sh [binary]
