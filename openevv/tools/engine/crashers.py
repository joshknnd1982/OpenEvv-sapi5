"""Find text the engine cannot survive.

Given a few strings that kill it, try every one-letter change to each --
substitution, insertion, deletion, over the letters and the apostrophe -- and
keep the ones that kill it too. Then do the same to those. The engine is the
oracle: a run that neither answers nor gives the utterance up is a find.

This is how test/cases/crashers.txt was made. Point it at a build with no
guards in it -- git stash, or an older tag -- to find more of them, and at the
build in the tree to check that none of them is left.

    tools/engine/crashers.py build/evv test/cases/crashers.txt 2

The third argument is how many rounds. One round off three strings takes a few
seconds; two takes about six minutes and turned three into ten thousand; three
would be four million candidates and several hours.
