"""The XML scanner's automaton, out of IBM's object.

`xmltok.obj' is not hand-written code: it is flex 2.5.4 output, and the
grammar it was generated from is not in the SDK. What is in the object is
the automaton flex built out of that grammar -- eight tables, three and a
half kilobytes of them -- and the skeleton that walks them, which is flex's
own and the same in every scanner it has ever generated.

So the skeleton is written out by hand in `src/eci/ssml/eci_xmltok.c', where it can
be read, and the tables are lifted here. Writing a scanner to the same
interface instead would have meant guessing the grammar from the tables and
then hoping every corner of it agreed; taking the automaton means the
tokenisation is the same by construction, on every input including the ones
nobody thought of.

The tables are the same in every one of the nine languages' object sets,
which was checked: this is engine code and not a language's data.

usage: tools/engine/xmltok.py [--check] [object]

With no argument it reads analysis/enus/xmltok.obj and writes
src/eci/ssml/eci_xmltok_tables.c. With --check it writes nothing and answers whether
what is in the tree is what the object says.
