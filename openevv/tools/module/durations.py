"""How long each segment lasts, and what that turns out to depend on.

`lang/enus/enus.segments' holds what every segment's parameters reach and no
span at all, because a span is not a property of a segment: the same phoneme
between the same neighbours at the same stress is one length in one word and
another in the next. `docs/authoring.md' has the measurement -- stress,
syllable count, something further off than a neighbour, position in the word.

So a duration table wants a longer key, and this measures how much longer
rather than guessing. It harvests every segment of the word corpus with the
prosodic context around it, then asks of each candidate key: of the contexts
seen more than once, how many came out the same length every time. A key that
answers everywhere is the key.
