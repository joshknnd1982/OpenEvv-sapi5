"""A language's alphabet, and what each character of it is.

The alphabet is the value names of the input statement's first field, and
beside it in the same statement is a record for every one of those names: what
case the character is, whether it is a letter or a digit or punctuation,
whether it is a vowel or a consonant or a glide, whether it carries an accent,
and the phoneme it stands for on its own. Which is letter-to-sound at its
simplest, and it is data rather than code.

Both are in `lang/<tag>/<tag>.statements`, the alphabet as `value' lines and
the records as the `variants' bytes of the same statement -- one record of five
bytes per name, in the order the names are in. Reading those bytes by eye and
writing them by hand is how a letter quietly comes out as a digit, so this
reads and writes them by name.

    tools/module/alphabet.py show <tag>              every character and what it is
    tools/module/alphabet.py show <tag> <char>...    only the ones named
    tools/module/alphabet.py add <tag> <byte> <field>=<value>...

`add' puts a character at a byte value nothing in the alphabet claims yet, so
that no existing code changes meaning: the dictionaries are keyed by these
codes and moving one would move every word that used it. The byte is what the
engine will see for that character once it arrives, in hex.

    tools/module/alphabet.py add plpl b1 case=lower type=letter letter=vow \\
                              accent='~yes' phoneme=a

usage: as above; `show' with no character lists the lot
