"""Which block of a formant rule actually fires, watched rather than read.

`tools/module/formants.py' reads the nine place-of-articulation rules and says
what values each block sets and what its guards test. The values are checked
against measurement and hold; the guards are read, and reading them wrongly is
easy -- a block runs from its label to the `goto' that ends it, and collecting
every test seen since the last label crosses the nested ifs the generated C is
full of, which had /t/'s 1750 guarded by a test naming /k/ when its real guard
is a feature of the item to the right.

So this does not read them. It puts a print at every value write in every one
of those rules, builds, speaks a corpus, and writes down which blocks fired
for each case. What comes out is a table of context to values that the engine
witnessed rather than one inferred from its source, and it needs no
understanding of the scan at all.

The instrumented C is generated rather than tracked, so it is stripped back
afterwards and `make rules' will rewrite it in any case.
