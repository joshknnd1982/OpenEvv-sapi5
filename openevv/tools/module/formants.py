"""What each place of articulation does to the formants, read out of the rules.

Every phoneme a language declares is "at" one of a handful of rules named for
a place of articulation -- `eng_lab_Fv', `eng_alv_Fv', `eng_lat_Fv' and so
on, which `tools/module/phonemes.py' prints beside each phoneme -- and those
rules are what compute its formant values. They are in the tree as C, `make
rules' having written them, so the values can be read rather than measured.

And they want reading rather than measuring, because they are not curves. Each
rule is a base locus and then a set of context-dependent overrides, every
value an integer immediate, chosen by a chain of tests: `eng_lat_Fv' has
fourteen. Sampling the output of that and fitting a continuous model to it is
what made /l/'s locus look unpredictable, the velar pinch look unidentifiable
and a run-out's level come out a hundred hertz wrong.

The slots hold no names -- a language declares its globals by kind and count,
so a slot's number is positional and the original's names are gone -- so the
mapping below is inferred from what the engine was measured doing, and three
consonants agree on it: `eng_alv_Fv' sets 1500 and 2550 where /t/ and /s/
between two /a/ measure f2 1500 and f3 2550; `eng_lab_Fv' sets 1000, 2200,
2250, 3300 and 3600 where /m/ measures f2 1000, f3 2200 rising to 2248, f4
3300 and f5 3600; `eng_lat_Fv' sets 800 and 3000 where /l/ measures f2 800
and f3 3000.
