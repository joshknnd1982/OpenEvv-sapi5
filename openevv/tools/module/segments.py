"""The segment table: what the engine's formant tracks are made of, as data.

A formant track is a list of breakpoints and the frames are what it unfolds
into, exactly -- `tools/measure/breaks.py' proves that. A run of the
generator is one phoneme, and it is two gaps: a transition of fixed length
into the phoneme's first target and an interior that runs to its second and
absorbs whatever length the duration model gave it. `docs/authoring.md' says
how that was established.

So the values are a table and this writes it. The key is the phoneme, the
phoneme either side and the stress on its syllable, which `--reach' shows is
the whole of what a target depends on. What is not in it is any length that
varies: the interior span is the duration model's and is recorded as what it
happened to be, marked, rather than as a property of the segment.

The corpus is not made up. `test/samples/enus.words' already holds what this
engine says each of twenty-four thousand words is made of, stress marks and
all, so speaking those covers exactly the contexts the language produces
rather than a cross product most of which never occurs. A key seen twice
that disagrees with itself is the check that the key is long enough, and is
reported rather than averaged.
