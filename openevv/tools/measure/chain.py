"""Compose a whole utterance from the pair tables, not just one carrier.

Everything so far composes a single vowel-consonant-vowel carrier. A word is a
chain of those, overlapping: in /atapa/ the /t/ is the (a,t) and (t,a) pairs,
the /p/ is (a,p) and (p,a), and the /a/ between them is the run-out of one and
the run-in of the next with the vowel's own body in the middle. So the pair
tables are enough for a word if they can be stitched, and this is the stitch.

What this does not do is decide the timing. When each closure starts and how
long it lasts is a language's business, decided long before the synthesiser
sees anything, so the frame layout is taken from the engine's own frames for
the same text. That is deliberate rather than a shortcut: it separates the
question this can answer -- do the tables describe real speech -- from the
question of what a language chooses to do, which is not a formant question.

A phoneme string is what the engine itself accepts, so `atapa' means the
utterance `` `[.1atapa] ``.

#
# Three things had to be right and each was found by the answer getting
# worse. The drop must not be taken off twice, a pair carrier's run-out
# already being the staircase. A closure must keep its own shape rather than
# one held value, /t/ holding 35 for four frames and then dropping to nought
# for its burst. And the voicing does not come back the moment the closure
# ends -- a voiceless stop holds it at nought through its release as well,
# /p/ for four frames past the `ah == 0' span and /k/ for five -- so starting
# the staircase there moved every step boundary with it and cost /atapa/ 60
# per cent against splicing's 14.5.
#
# The rule, measured over /a/, /aa/, /ama/, /amama/, /amamama/, /imi/, /umu/,
# /AmA/, /imu/, /ini/ and /asa/: the staircase does not decline across an
# utterance, it RESETS after every consonant. After each closure the voicing
# resumes at the FOLLOWING vowel's own value less three and steps down by one,
# four steps, over that vowel. /a/ is 50 and gives 47 46 45 44; /A/ is 49 and
# gives 46 45 44 43; /u/ is 59 and gives 56 55 54 53, and it gives those in
# /imu/ as well as /umu/, so it is the vowel after the consonant that decides
# and not the one before.
#
# /imi/ looks like an exception and is not: /i/ is 55, so its staircase starts
# at 52, which is also what /m/ holds through its own closure, and the two
