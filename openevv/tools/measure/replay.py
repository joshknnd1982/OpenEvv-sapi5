"""Build frames from the measured table, and hold them against the engine's.

The point of measuring a phoneme is to be able to produce it, and the point of
producing it is that the comparison is exact: same text, same parameter
frames, and the audio is identical because the synthesiser below is unchanged.
No ear, no alignment, no judgement.

So this reads every `lang/measured/enus-*.txt' table, builds the frames each
case wants, and compares them against what the engine actually gave KlattSynth
for the same text. What it does not model is f0, which is the intonation and
moves over an utterance rather than belonging to a phoneme; the tables say so
and this excludes it from the comparison rather than pretending.
