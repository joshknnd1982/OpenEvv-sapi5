"""Formant frames out of the two tables, with no rule in the path.

`lang/enus/enus.segments' says what each segment's parameters reach and
`lang/enus/enus.durations' says how long each segment lasts and how it splits
into pieces. Between them that is a formant track: the pieces are the spans,
the targets are what each span ends at, and a frame every five milliseconds is
the straight line between them in whole numbers.

So this generates a word's frames from the tables and the phoneme string
alone, and holds them against what the synthesiser was actually told. The
trailing silence is left out of the comparison: it is not a phoneme and the
duration table has no entry for it.

    tools/measure/generate.py <probe> [--words N] [--tag enus] [--show WORD]
    tools/measure/generate.py <probe> --wav <out dir> <word>...

The second writes three wave files a word, all rendered by
`test/harness/klattplay' so the comparison is fair: the engine's own frames,
the frames these tables make, and a third with the tables' spectrum over the
engine's excitation. The excitation envelopes are where the tables are
weakest -- they are how hard the utterance is voiced and blown, and that is
the utterance's business rather than a segment's -- so the third says how
much of any difference is the spectrum and how much is the envelope.

The pitch is borrowed in all cases. It is the phrase's melody and no segment
table can hold it; this engine generates it in a pass of its own.
