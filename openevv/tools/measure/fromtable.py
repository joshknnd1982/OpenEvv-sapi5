"""Check a word's formants against the segment table, segment by segment.

`lang/enus/enus.segments' says what each segment's parameters reach, keyed by
the phoneme, the phoneme either side and the stress. It does not say how long
anything takes, because that is the duration model's and is not a property of
a segment -- `docs/authoring.md' has the measurement.

So what can be checked is the values, and it is checked where the table
states them: every run of every word, every parameter, against what the
table says that phoneme in that context at that stress reaches. A word all
of whose segments agree is a word whose formants the table could have
generated, given the durations.

Rebuilding the frames by substitution was tried first and measures nothing
useful: the table collapses a repeated target and drops one that runs
through into the next segment, so putting its values back on the engine's
own gap list mostly misaligns them, and the misalignment is the harness's
rather than the table's.
