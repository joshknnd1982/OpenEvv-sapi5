"""What each vowel does to each consonant, read out of the measured tables.

Across a consonant between two vowels, f1 holds one value and f2 and f3 ramp
straight from one value to another. This finds that stretch in every measured
carrier and reports the value at each end of it, so the question "what does an
/i/ before an /m/ do to it" has a number rather than an impression.

The stretch is the longest run of frames in the interior at one f1, which is
what a consonant is in this engine whatever its manner: /m/ between two /a/
holds f1 at 300, /t/ and /s/ hold it at 300 too, and what tells those apart is
the frication and the voicing rather than the formants.

Given two tables measured as different Latin squares, `--compare' holds the
one against the other. Every (consonant, vowel) pair appears in both, with a
different vowel at the far end, so agreement between them is the test of
whether a value belongs to the neighbour that sets it or to the pair as a
whole. Disagreement is coarticulation reaching further than one phoneme.

    than a consonant, so only interior runs count and a marker that finds
    none answers None -- which lets the next marker be tried. Falling back to

    exact: over the twenty-six consonants between two /a/ the `ah == 0' span
    agrees frame for frame with the stretch held at one f1 for twenty of them.

    **Voicing going to nought** is /h/, which is aspiration itself and so
    never suppresses it -- it lifts `ah' from 34 to 37 instead -- but does
    stop the voice.

    **The third bandwidth leaving the vowel's own value** is the five
    sonorants, /r/, /l/, /y/, /w/ and /R/. They have no amplitude marker at
    all: voicing stays up, frication stays at nought, aspiration stays at its
    baseline, and only the formants move. But every one of them takes `b3'
    away from the 150 a vowel holds -- to 250, 400, 500, 550 and 250 -- with
    the extremum squarely in the interior, so the departure is the anchor.

    An earlier version of this had only the first marker and answered None for
    the other six, which was honest but cost 96 of the 416 carriers at 175
    words a minute and 124 at 700. The one thing it must not do is guess: a
