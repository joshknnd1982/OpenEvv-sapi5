"""What a sample rate does to the sound, in numbers rather than opinions.

The engine will now synthesise at rates IBM never shipped, and the question
that decides whether that is worth anything is not whether it makes a noise.
It is whether the formants are still where they were -- the resonator tables
encode a frequency as a fraction of the sample rate, so a table built for the
wrong rate puts every formant in the wrong place while the speech stays
perfectly fluent and merely sounds like somebody else.

So this reads the same sentence spoken at several rates and puts the two
things that matter beside each other. Where the peaks of the long-term
average spectrum are, which must not move; and how much energy sits above
5,512 hertz, which is what a rate above eleven thousand and twenty five can
carry and eleven thousand cannot, and is therefore the whole of what there is
to listen for.

Pure Python and no numpy, as tools/measure/pitch.py is and for the same reason: the
dev shell has neither.
