"""Generate a carrier the tables have never seen, and see how close it is.

Every measured table reproduces the engine exactly, which proves the
measurement and not the format. What proves the format is generating an
utterance nobody measured: `lang/measured/enus-holdout.txt' is 416 carriers at
a vowel offset neither training square uses, so a composer built from
`enus-pairs.txt' and `enus-pairs2.txt' has seen no frame of it.

The model being tested is the one the measurements argued for. For a carrier
V1-C-V2:

Timing comes from the left pair. When the closure starts and how long it lasts
are functions of the preceding vowel and the consonant, measured over 320
pairs at 320 of 320, so both are taken from a training carrier sharing V1
and C.

A parameter that holds one value through the closure is taken from the right:
the following vowel sets it, f1 agreeing between squares on 632 of 640.

A parameter that ramps across the closure runs from the left carrier's onset
to the right carrier's offset, since one end is set by each neighbour.

And the run-in is a fixed shape scaled to its target. /a/ into /m/ runs 705
then 330 when the closure is at 300, and 700 then 284 when it is at 250: both
one tenth and fourteen fifteenths of the way from 750 to wherever it is going.
So the run-in is reproduced as fractions of the left carrier's own run-in,
stretched to the target the right carrier asks for, and the run-out likewise.

    tools/measure/compose.py <train> <train> <holdout> [--true-length]
    tools/measure/compose.py <train> <train> <holdout> --write <dir> [case]...

`--write' puts two frame files a case into a directory, the measured frames
and the composed ones, in the form test/harness/klattplay.c reads. That is how
this gets listened to rather than counted: both sides through the same
renderer, so the only difference is the frames. With no case named it writes
the four that span the range -- the closest, the median, the worst, and the
worst velar.
