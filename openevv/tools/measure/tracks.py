"""Fit a phoneme's parameter tracks to breakpoints, exactly.

The synthesiser is told sixty-two numbers a frame and it is told them as
piecewise-linear tracks: a parameter is given targets and walks a straight
line between them. So the faithful way to write a phoneme down is the way the
engine already thinks of it -- per parameter, the frames at which it turns and
the value it turns at -- and not as a fixed number of targets, which cannot
express what /aU/ actually does.

Between two breakpoints the value is

    v0 + int((v1 - v0) * min(den, 2 * (i - i0)) / den)

with `den' the segment's length in half-frames and the conversion truncating
towards nought, which is what C does. `den' is twice the segment's length in
frames for almost every segment; where it is not, the fit says so and the
table carries it.
