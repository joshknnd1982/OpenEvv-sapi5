# What one word's letter rules do differently from IBM's.
#
# tools/rules/check-upper.sh holds an authored rule to entering the same rules
# and making the same calls as the one it stands in for, over whole sentences.
# A letter rule written in lang/<tag>/letters is not that: it says `afresh',
# so that check leaves it alone deliberately, and what is wanted here is the
# opposite -- the two traces will differ, and the question is where.
#
# So this speaks one word through a build carrying IBM's letter rules and
# through one carrying ours, with tracing on, and prints the first place they
# part company. That is the difference between reading a rule's call list and
# guessing what it means, which has been wrong three times, and being told
# which call differs and with what arguments.
#
# The masking is check-upper.sh's and for its reasons: a value of 0x10000 or
# more is a distance into the region, which the two builds are entitled to
# place differently, and comparing those compares the layout rather than the
# behaviour. Everything below that is compared exactly, which is every
# immediate a rule carries.
#
# What is compared is what the rules do to the word, not every call they make.
# A rule of ours legitimately does less work than IBM's -- it tests the run it
# wants where IBM tests one letter at a time and backtracks -- so the calls are
# hundreds of lines apart even where the answer is identical, and that noise
# hides the one line that matters. So the comparison is over the calls that
# change the spine: what phones went in, what came out, and what was marked.
# EVV_LETTERS_ALL=1 compares every call instead, which is what to reach for
# when the two agree on every insertion and the sound still differs.
#
# And --sound asks the other question: not which call differs but whether
# anything can be heard to. It speaks every word of a list through both builds
# and names each word whose samples differ. That is what the two gates cannot
# say about a letter rule. test/words.sh reads the phoneme report, which prints
# a phone's name and nothing else it carries, so an n laid down where IBM lays
# down a velar nasal marked to be written as n reads the same there and sounds
# different; and test/matrix.sh hears only what its sentences happen to hold,
# which in Italian was no n before a hard c, g or q at all.
#
# usage: tools/rules/check-letters.sh <tag> <word>...
#        tools/rules/check-letters.sh <tag> -f <file>   a word to a line
#        tools/rules/check-letters.sh <tag> --sound [<file>]
#                                         the language's word list by default
#
# EVV_LETTERS_LINES says how many differing lines to print, twenty by default,
# and EVV_LETTERS_JOBS how many words --sound speaks at once, eight by default.
