"""What each entry the machine can call takes, read from its declaration.

A rule pushes values and the machine hands them over; where a reference is an
address the two are the same thing and nothing needs saying. Where it is not
-- a distance into the region, which is what lets that region live anywhere --
each argument has to be converted or not according to whether the entry wants
a pointer, and the only place that is written down is the entry's own C
declaration. So this reads them.

The answer is a mask per entry: bit n set means argument n is a pointer, and
bit 31 means the entry answers with one. A module's own rules are not in here
at all -- they take references and keep them, so their mask is nought.
