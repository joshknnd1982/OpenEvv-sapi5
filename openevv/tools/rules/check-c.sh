# Hold rules written as C against the same rules left as bytecode.
#
# The engine says which rule it is entering and with what, and every call it
# makes with its arguments, and a rule written as C goes through the same two
# functions and says the same. So the same sentence spoken twice, once with the
# rules compiled and once without, either says exactly the same thing or the
# translation is wrong somewhere. The audio is the coarser check behind this
# one: a rule can go wrong in a way that changes what runs and not what is
# heard.
#
# Four things about the comparison are deliberate, all of them the harness
# rather than the translation, and all of them found by this failing:
#
# One sentence at a time, in its own run of the engine. Tracing costs twenty
# times what the synthesis does, and while any one of the seven cases traces
# through to the end, seven in one run faults part way with less audio written
# -- so the traces stop in different places and nothing lines up. Each of the
# seven on its own is fine, and the fault is in feeding the synthesis far
# slower than it expects rather than in either form of the rules.
#
# Two kinds of line come out, both printed by the interpreter alone. It prints
# every store it makes, and a rule written as C makes its own and has nothing
# to print. And it says when the count a call carries for how deep the argument
# area should be disagrees with how deep it is, which is a remark about the
# compiled code rather than about either form of it.
#
# The rules are written out with EVV_FAITHFUL set, which leaves a wrapper rule
# as a call to that rule. Without it the decompiler writes out the primitive
# the wrapper stood for, so the wrapper rule is never entered and cannot appear
# in a trace at all. That is the inlining working, but it leaves nothing to
# compare. Every other pass is in either way, and the suites are the only check
# on the inlining itself.
#
# Addresses in the arena are masked. A rule written as C deliberately takes a
# smaller frame than the interpreter's, so the two land in different places,
# and where a frame landed is not what this is checking.
#
# usage: tools/rules/check-c.sh <rule>...
