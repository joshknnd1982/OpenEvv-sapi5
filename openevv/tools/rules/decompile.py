"""One of the language's rules as C, instead of as bytecode for the machine
IBM's compiler wrote it for.

The machine is small -- eight registers, four flags, a frame of bytes
addressed from a base, and calls out to the runtime -- and every one of the
1,164 plain things the rules call is a function we have already written. So
the translation is not a matter of working out what anything means; it is a
matter of writing the same operations in C and proving the result does the
same thing.

Faithful before pretty. What comes out keeps the machine's own shape: the
frame is a buffer, the registers are locals, and a call is the same call with
the same arguments in the same order. Where the bytecode jumps, this goes to a
label. Recovering the loops and the conditionals is a separate pass, and one
that cannot start until this one is known to be exact.

Nothing about the machine's arithmetic is written again here. The flags and
the operations that set them came out of the interpreter into delta_rule_alu,
delta_rule_cmp and delta_condition, which both it and this call, so neither
can drift from the other over what a comparison afterwards will say.

Proving it: the engine says which rule it is entering and with what when
DELTA_RULE_TRACE is set, and a rule compiled from here is entered through the
same function and says the same. So the same text spoken twice, once with a
rule compiled and once without, either names the same rules in the same order
with the same arguments or the translation is wrong. tools/rules/check-c.sh does
that, with EVV_FAITHFUL set so that a wrapper is left as the call it was; the
comment at the top of it says what else that comparison needs and what would
make it finer. Both suites are the coarser check behind it, and the only one
for the inlining itself.

/* Generated by tools/rules/decompile.py. Do not edit.

   Rules of the language written as C rather than run as bytecode. Each keeps
   the shape of the machine its compiler wrote it for -- the frame is a
   buffer, the registers are locals, and a call is the same call with the same
   arguments -- because being the same thing matters more here than reading
   well. Recovering the loops and the conditionals comes after this is known
   to be exact.

   This is one of %d such files. Together they are some thirteen megabytes,
   which is a quarter of an hour of compiler in one translation unit and about
   a minute spread over as many cores as the machine has. Which rules land in
   which file is settled by size, so that the files finish together; nothing
   else depends on where a rule is.

   delta_rule_native names the ones written down; the interpreter looks there
   first and runs a rule from here when it finds one. Each file carries its own
   piece of that table and the first gathers the pieces. */

    conventions agree belongs to the callee. So a register the rule writes
    after planting the landing, and reads after coming back to it without
    writing it first, has to be somewhere the save cannot lose -- which is
    what volatile is for.

    A register that is only ever written before the landing is not one of
