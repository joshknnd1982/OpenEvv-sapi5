"""Letter-to-sound as a file a person can edit.

A language's letter rules are one rule to a letter -- `a_rules' through
`z_rules' in `lang/<tag>/rules/et_phone.dr' -- and each is a list of arms tried
in order. An arm sets the scan on the letters, tests what stands there, saves
where the scan got to, and spells the range between the two points as phones.
That is letter-to-sound and nothing else, so this is the file it wants to be
written in:

    letter b
      bt    says t        # debt
      b     says b

One block a letter, arms in order, the first that matches winning, and the last
arm of a block the bare letter with no test at all -- what the letter says when
nothing else applies. An arm may also say what must stand to its left and right
without swallowing it -- `after', `before', and `vowel', `consonant' or `glide'
in either place -- and whether the run has to begin or end where the piece of
the word does, which is `at start' and `at end'. And an arm may end by marking
the phones it laid down, `marked <field> <value>', in the phone statement's own
names: Italian's doubled consonants are `geminate yes'. Last of all it may say
which words it is for, `where the root begins <list>', `where the root is
<list>' or `where the root so far is <list>', naming one of the language's own
lookup sets: Italian's s is unvoiced between vowels where the root begins
VsV_pronounced_s, and its gi keeps the i where the root so far, up to the end
of the gi, is one of i_pronounced_i.
`the word' in place of `the root' matches from the word's own start, which
wants the line `a word runs from <start> to <end>'.

A silent letter `says nothing', and an arm that `is left alone' matches and
does nothing at all, leaving the letter to whatever the machine does with one
nobody spelled; Italian's h is the first everywhere but where it begins the
root, and the second there. `before' may join letters and kinds with `+' --
`tt+vowel' -- and `accented' asks for the letter's own accent flag.

After the phones, an arm may say what must not hold: `unless before <letters>',
with `at end' if it must end the root, `unless the root is <list>', `unless
the root begins <list>' and `unless the root so far is <list>', as many as it
needs. That is IBM's `not', a test that abandons the arm when it succeeds.
`where the word passes <rule>' asks one of the language's own rules of the
whole word -- Italian's o is open in a word one_ital_syllable passes -- and
`hands over to <rule>' in place of `says' gives the letter to one, as a
homograph is given to the rule that knows its part of speech.

The phones are the ETI phone letters, the same ones `lang/<tag>/<tag>.dict'
already uses, and the letters are the language's own characters.

What it writes is `lang/<tag>/rules/et_phone.up', which the build compiles over
the lifted text in the ordinary way, so a rule written here stands where IBM's
compiled one stood and `test/words.sh' says whether any of 24,318 words moved.

The strings an arm needs -- the letters it tests and the phones it lays down --
are minted here and written to `lang/<tag>/rules/constants.letters', because a
symbol belongs to the object its rule came out of and a letter rule of ours
cannot name the ones IBM's name. `tools/rules/consts.py' lays them down, and
`make letters' is the two in that order.

# second of them along.
#
# An arm's condition is a test that the scan has arrived at one end of the
# second pair, which is what `test_ptr' answers, and it is not decoration:
# `b' before `t' says nothing in debt and says /b/ in ob-tain and sub-tract,

# walks, the phones an arm lays down -- and the number each has is the
