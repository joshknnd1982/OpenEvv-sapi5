"""The rules as text that can be read, edited and compiled back.

The rules reach us as compiled x86 in IBM's objects. `tools/rules/lift.py` turns one
into blocks of operations over operands, and `tools/rules/emit.py` turns those into
the bytecode the engine runs. That middle form is the thing worth writing down:
it is one to one with what the machine does, so it can be written out and read
back without loss, and once it is in the tree the rules can be edited and the
objects are no longer needed to rebuild them.

This lifts IBM's objects into that form and holds the tree against them.
`write' lifts an object and prints it; `read' parses it back; `check' does both
and holds the bytecode emitted from each against the other, byte for byte,
which is the whole proof. The form itself -- the printing and the parsing -- is
in tools/rules/lower.py, because tools/rules/upper.py writes the same form from
above and a second copy of the print and the parse is the one fault it can
have.

What the text is not is the readable C that `tools/rules/decompile.py` writes. That
restructures into loops and conditionals for a person to read, and inverting it
exactly would be hard. Reading and round-tripping are different jobs, so they
have different forms.
