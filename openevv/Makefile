# Python is, because the rules a build compiles are written out of the text in
# lang/<tag>/rules rather than kept beside it.
#
# `make probe' builds the driver the tests drive instead. It is the same
# engine with a different front: it prints what the engine answered at every
# step so that test/suite.sh can set those answers against IBM's own binary
# line for line, which is why it is not the thing a person would run.
#
# `make evv32' and `make probe32' build the same two thirty-two bit. That
# build is kept because a difference between the word sizes is a layout
# mistake caught early, and it costs about a minute. It needs a thirty-two
# bit compiler, which is CC32 below.
#
# `make missing' says what our code asks for that nothing of ours answers.
# It answers nothing now, and it is worth re-running whenever a source is
# added, since a name that reappears there is a call that has quietly gone
# back to the original.

#
# Both speak the same samples -- that is what test/suite.sh holds them to, over
# all 81 cases in both forms -- so this is a trade of build for speed and
# nothing else. C is the default because the speed is what a person waiting for
# speech feels: the same utterance synthesises in rather less than half the
# time, and interrupting one and asking for another costs a third of what it
# costs interpreted, since the engine cannot abandon an utterance and has to
# finish the one it was told to stop.
#
# What it costs. Writing the files is about two minutes of Python and
# compiling them fifteen seconds over twenty-four cores, where the bytecode
# build is half a minute and the two seconds a language RULECODE costs below.
